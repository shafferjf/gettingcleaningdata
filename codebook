The codebook for all variables used in this project is listed below.

Variables in final tidy data set per column number:

1. Subject - subject number (1 to 30)
2. Activity - type of activity (from activity_labels.txt - walking, walking_upstairs, walking_downstairs, sitting, standing, laying)
3. to 81. Means of each measurement (names from features.txt)


Variables used in "run_analysis.R" script:

1. features - list of measurement variable names from UCI HAR Datset
2. test - data frame of test data
3. subjects_test - subjects data for test condition
4. activities_test - activities data for test conditon
5. training - data frame of training data
6. subjects_train - subjects data for training condition
7. activities_train - activities data for training conditon
8. test_data - data frame of test data, subjects, and activities
9. training_data - data frame of training data, subjects, and activities
10. merged - merged data frame of test_data and training_data
11. subjects - subjects column from merged
12. activities - activities column from merged
13. mean_cols - names in merged that include the string "mean"
14. onlymeans - columns from merged that include variable name with "mean"
15. mean_names - names in merged that include the string "mean"
16. std_cols - names in merged that include the string "std"
17. onlystds - columns from merged that include variable name with "std"
18. std_names - names in merged that include the string "std"
19. means_stds - data frame with subjects, activities, and only variables that include "mean" or "std"
20. activityX - logical vector with data for activityX (1 to 6) from activity column in means_stds
21. tidy_data - means_stds grouped by subject and activity
22. tidy_data_final - summary data of means of each variable by subject and activity
